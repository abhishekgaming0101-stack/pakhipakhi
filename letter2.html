        <h1 class="love-text">REQUEST LETTER ❤️</h1>

        <p class="letter-body">
            In the previous SORRY LETTER I talked about the changes I have to bring in myself, in this letter I will request you with the changes you and we both should bring to make our relationship healthy and to make us the best couple in the whole world
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Loving yourself, I want you to love yourself more, every time you face a problem you talk bad about yourself.
You start talking about how you don't deserve happiness 
You start calling yourself ugly, whore. I want you to stop doing that. I know it is your way to cope with things but it is wrong, this doesn't make anything better it just makes everything more wrong. Pakhi you are beautiful, you are the kindest soul I have ever met, your behaviour, your dressing sense nothing matches to it and I want you to know your one in a billion and I'll always love you
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Suicidal thoughts, I have tried showing empathy to you before like how things will change, how we will go very far away from your parents but you have to understand after sometime it started scaring me, isliye I started begging you not to talk about it 
I know there are phases where life feels pointless, where you don’t see dreams or ambition, and everything feels empty. That doesn’t mean life has no value. These thoughts come when someone is overwhelmed, not because life is actually meaningless.
Moments with people, small memories, and connections are what give life meaning like the fun we had at Samiksha’s place getting all drunk and also at Bird Valley. Moments like these can still exist, even if right now you can’t feel that hope fully.
But I also want you to know that self harming, overdosing on pills, or thinking of suicide is not an answer or an escape. These actions won’t make things right  they only put you in danger. And they will put your relationship with people in danger
        </p>

            Expressing Anger, if you are angry at me, then your usual tareeka of being angry is right no problem with that, but if you got angry related to something else, then I want you not to be angry on me, you distance me, mere call nahi uthat, mere msg ka reply nahi deti, tu mujhpe blame daal deti hai and then you think ki Abhishek ne toh mujhe manaya hi nahi, Abhishek is only for good times and not for bad times. Let's change this, agar tu kisi aur cheez ke wajah se gussa hai then follow the following steps:
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Step 1: Keep me close to you.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Step 2 : Talk to me talk about how you hate that thing, subj or person.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Step 3 : Talk about how we will handle the situation.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Step 4 : We both go for a drive.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Step 5 : We eat gupta ji ki Paani Puri
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Step 6 : You tell me to cook something for you, whatever you feel like eating
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Step 7 : We hug each other, cuddle maybe we make out, if needed we have sex, jaise Mera coa ka paper kharab gaya tha then we had sex that night, trust me it does work in relieving the stress.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Voila, following the above 7 steps you just solved the problem and now you are not even angry
