            I love how we are comfortable with each other, we are not afraid or ashamed of each other. Many of your habits I love a lot the way we have made love gestures like how you always come to saying "Bra kholde" 🎀and also pehne ke waqt you say "meri bra dedo" 🎀and when I give it to you the way you say "Pehna bhi do" 🎀 all this little things of you speaks I love you to me ❤️. The way I pick fits for you, the way we do each other's massage hum ek dusre ko hair oil laga dete hai also hum ek dusre ko nehalate hai 😁 it is also special. The way we joke around ek dusre ke puche bhagte hai, mast karte hai 🥰 like hum ek dusre ek presence mein we become babies and it is all magical

            The truth is pakhi I can't even think about losing you, I don't want to lose you, i don't want to hurt you, you are my baby and every time you get hurt, I feel bad everytime you cry I start feeling guilty, i cherish you pakhi for my whole life 
And I can't give up on this relationship, I don't want to start again with anyone, I don't want to open up with anyone, i don't want to get comfortable with anyone..... I just want all this things with you, all this are special things between us, you are special to me

            Now that I am at home I know how much I miss you, jab bhi meri mummy khana bana ne ke liye bolti hai I don't feel like cooking, cause I love cooking only for you ❤️. I was thinking of the times when we come late in Alandi and I have to sleep at my flat the way I miss you during those nights, the way we both decide subha 5 baje aa jana scooty leke 😭. We both can't live without each other even for a night

            I promise you pakhi to be a better boyfriend, to be a better person. I will take care of you 🥺. Abse I'll make sure you have a clean diet, I'll make sure you exercise regularly, I'll make sure we go to college regularly and study for the exams beforehand. I will give you a massage anytime you need, I'll take care of your hair and health. I'll oil and serum your hair from time to time. I'll make sure you take your medicines daily. I'll make sure of your meethi dana, I'll make sure to kiss you, to suck your boobs, to make out with you and have sex with you. I'll make sure to be emotionally available for you, I'll make sure to handle your anger. I'll make sure to always be there for you
