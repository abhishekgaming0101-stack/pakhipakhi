            My dear pakhu for the last few months we are fighting and things are changing between us, I know my actions made you feel insecure it made you question us and our love, And I'm really sorry for it 
And I'm not just sorry but I have also decided to bring an actual change and never let things between us wrong again
        </p>

        <p class="letter-body">
            About saving those reels, I know that was an unnecessary foolish action, but it has left a scar on you that will always make you question me that will always make you think that I will cheat in future  
I know what I did was wrong and I should own my mistake saving those reels wasn’t about wanting someone else or losing interest in you. It was a careless habit, mindless scrolling and maybe it was really a temporary momentary attraction. And it made you feel insecure and disrespected and I take responsibility for that 
I am not emotionally cheating, and I don’t want anyone else. But I agree that this crossed a boundary for you, and I should have been more aware. And I promise you this will not repeat ever again. And I swear this in our relationship
        </p>

        <p class="letter-body">
            Remember, each word is a token of love that she can read and smile. Take your time to write with sincerity and warmth.
