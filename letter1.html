            My dear pakhu for the last few months we are fighting and things are changing between us, I know my actions made you feel insecure it made you question us and our love, And I'm really sorry for it 
And I'm not just sorry but I have also decided to bring an actual change and never let things between us wrong again
        </p>

        <p class="letter-body">
            About saving those reels, I know that was an unnecessary foolish action, but it has left a scar on you that will always make you question me that will always make you think that I will cheat in future  
I know what I did was wrong and I should own my mistake saving those reels wasn’t about wanting someone else or losing interest in you. It was a careless habit, mindless scrolling and maybe it was really a temporary momentary attraction. And it made you feel insecure and disrespected and I take responsibility for that 
I am not emotionally cheating, and I don’t want anyone else. But I agree that this crossed a boundary for you, and I should have been more aware. And I promise you this will not repeat ever again. And I swear this on our relationship
        </p>

        <p class="letter-body">
            Second thing talking to pranjal. What I see is I am talking to a friend who might or might not have feelings for me but she knows I have a gf. But from your perspective it is I am talking to someone who clearly has a crush on me and pranjal knowing that we are in a relationship she will try to sabotage us. I never thought about this from your perspective, I never thought that you see her as a threat, even though she might or might not do it but you don't want to take risks in that probability. I failed to understand that you are keeping our relationship above you trying to save us from her, mansi or disha 
I should have thought of this
And I'm sorry I didn't think it through
But now i promise you I'll not talk to any girl or even a boy who could possibly cause a threat to us, to our relationship
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Third thing the night I walked out, you were angry at me because I recognised that face on the profile photo that it is lavanya and not disha and also you were angry on me because of what mayank and jignesh said and when you had breakdown I walked out, you have every reason to be angry at me for this and I'm very sorry for this 
But I wasn't wrong at my place too, I tried explaining to you, mene tujhe manaya bhi tha but that "Don't touch me" it hurt me it made me feel unwanted, it made me feel i don't belong in that room, it made me feel that my presence and touch is being hated that's why I left that night. But I promise to change my behaviour, to be better at handling such situations
        </p>
        <p class="letter-body">
            Empathy, I know you expect empathy from me and ofc you will, I am your boyfriend you dream your future with me. I should be the first person to show empathy to you, to understand you and to make sure to solve all your problems. And I'm sorry I didn't do that job well. But I'm trying my best.
The thing is I want to show empathy but you don't express your anger and emotions in the right way.
Even you will agree with this 
During java paper, when your mom was not behaving with you nicely all that time you picked a fight with me how was i supposed to show empathy, you were blaming most of the things on me, even java ke exams ke baad you brought everything on me ki "tujhpe trust nahi karna chahiye tha, you made me go through abortion" how was i supposed to show empathy on that day 
Jab java ka result aya mein tujhe mana ne ka try kar raha tha but tu continuously bol rahi thi mujhe space de, apne kan se kam rakh, how was i supposed to show empathy then
We both are wrong for each other, and we both are right for ourselves and I want to change that 
I want us to handle things in the right way... I want you to Express your anger and inconvenience in the right way and I promise you I will pamper you like a baby, cook your fav food for you, hear you vent it out, and then I'll give you a big tight hug and then mein tujhe apne upar sula dunga
